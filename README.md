  - Structure of the calculator

  - Functionality and interactivity

## What I learned :

This was one of my first projects made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so everything was quite new to me! I feel like I learned a lot while creating this calculator, from improving my CSS skills to ensuring that the design was responsive and attractive.

Working on this project gave me some headaches at first, especially when it came to validating user inputs. But in the end, I learned to handle the validation to ensure that only valid numbers and operations were accepted, which turned out to be a significant improvement.

It was also a rewarding experience to add interactivity to the page, making the calculator respond to clicks and update the user interface. This whole process has been an incredible journey, and I hope to learn much more in the future.
